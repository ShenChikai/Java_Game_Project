# Project Description
## This is a team project on a Diner-Dash-like game in JAVA
Diner Dash is a popular ultra-casual game that serves people everywhere in their need to waste
the precious time they have on this Earth. The gameplay involves controlling a waitress who sits and
serves guests in a bustling restaurant. However, not everyone enjoys the aesthetic of Diner Dash, and
therefore the need for ‘Office Hour’ arises. Our ‘Office Hour’ will be a reskin of Diner Dash, wherein the
user controls a CP tending to the needs of the struggling students, a perfect game for students accustomed
to wasting away their lives in SAL and find the activity comforting in times of boredom and
procrastination.
